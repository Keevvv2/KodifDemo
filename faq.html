    <div class="faq-item active"><button>Are your supplements vegan?</button><div><p>Most of our formulations are 100% vegan, except where noted (e.g., marine collagen in Glow Within). We clearly mark any exceptions on the label and always offer plant-based alternatives.</p></div></div>
    <div class="faq-item active"><button>Are your products gluten-free?</button><div><p>Yes, all Sona Vitalis products are certified gluten-free and safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac conditions.</p></div></div>
    <div class="faq-item active"><button>Where are your products made?</button><div><p>All products are formulated and manufactured in FDA-registered, GMP-compliant facilities in the U.S. We source globally with a preference for fair-trade, regenerative farms.</p></div></div>

    <div class="faq-item active"><button>Do you test on animals?</button><div><p>Never. Sona Vitalis is 100% cruelty-free. We believe in nourishing life, not harming it.</p></div></div>
